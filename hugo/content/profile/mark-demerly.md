Heading up his own firm allows Mark to focus on what he values most: designing homes for people to enjoy. His professional, civic and community interests are fueled by his passion for making Indianapolis communities better places to live. As the Midtown Economic Council representative, he advocates for responsible growth and more public amenities in Midtown Indianapolis development. He launched the Broad Ripple Winter Market to support sustainability and enable local producers and growers to expand their businesses. In short order, the market became a prized amenity for northside residents. Mark has served as the president for IMA Design Arts and Contemporary Arts support groups, and is a past president and founding member of the national AIA Custom Residential Architect Network committee, which has advocated for and increased awareness of the residential architecture profession. He serves on Broad Ripple’s Land Use and Development Committee and participates in numerous other community initiatives. Mark’s devotion to cooking and food has helped inspire his designs for the restaurants the firm has developed for the city’s top chefs. His love of nature, hiking and the outdoors has led to community gardens and memorials to those who have contributed much.

Mark has Bachelor of Science in X and Bachelor of Science in Architecture degrees from Ball State University.
